# QuickRN Basic Template

Bare-bones template based on my usual setup for React Native projects.

## What it includes

- Latest version of React Native (v0.66.4)
- React Native SVG
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [AppCenter](https://appcenter.ms)
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)


## How to use

You can either download, fork or run the following command:

```$ npx react-native init exampleProject --template QuickRN/quickrn-template-bottom-tab```

Make sure to rename the project by running

```$ npx react-native-rename [NAME_OF_PROJECT]```
